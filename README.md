# Airbnb-Property-Optimization-Strategy
This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of an Airbnb dataset to uncover key business insights and visualise using Tableau.

## Business Problem
Client wants to start an Airbnb business. They want to know where they should buy a property and list it on Airbnb to rent it out. We need to analyse and optimize factors like location, number of bedrooms, the amount of money they can charge, etc to help select the most profitable property.

## Software Used
Tableau Public

## Data Source
[Airbnb Data 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hriditabasu/airbnb-data-2016)    

This dataset comprises of:
- Listings: Description of the properties like the unique id, neighbourhood, property type, etc.
- Calender: Lists details like the date and availability.
- Review: Description of the reviews like the date, reviewer name, comment, etc.

## Methodology
Do an inner join on Listings and Calender tables where Id (Listings) = Listing Id (Calender).      
Since we won’t require the Reviews table for our analysis, we can leave it out.

### Visualizations
1. **Price by Zipcode (Sheet 1):**      
   This can help us determine which zipcodes have the costliest listings so buying a property in those zipcodes would enable the client to charge the most.      
   It is visualized as a bar chart sorted in descending order to show the average prices of properties in the respective zipcodes from the highest to the lowest.

2. **Price Per Zipcode (Sheet 2):**      
   A map chart to visualize zipcodes and their respective average prices to find the most profitable areas.

3. **Revenue for Year (Sheet 3):**      
   Client also wants to live in the property himself, so he wants to know what the best times would be to list it on Airbnb to rent it out to other people. Hence, we must find out when people are spending the most money on Airbnb.      
We use the Date (Year and then break it out by Week Number) and filter it to only use records until 31st December 2016, and visualize it against the sum of price (Calender).        
Based on this visualization it can be observed that business is slow towards the beginning of the year and perks up during the summer and the holidays so that’s when the property should be rented out.

4. **Average Price vs Number of Bedrooms (Sheet 4):**    
   Average price generated based on number of bedrooms in the properties (exclude Null and 0 bedrooms as that’s not helpful to us). It is seen that the properties with a greater number of bedrooms are a much better investment.

5. **Number of Bedrooms vs Listings (Sheet 5):**
   Number of listings based on number of bedrooms by visualizing number of bedrooms against the distinct listing ids.       
   It is observed that with increasing number of bedrooms, the number of listings decreases showcasing a downward trend in competition.

## Dashboard
All the visualizations are thus combined into the following interactive dashboard:

## Insights
1. Three of the most profitable areas are in Seattle, Washington with zipcodes 98119, 98121 and 98136 respectively.
2. Business is slow at the beginning of the year therefore it is more profitable to list the property on Airbnb towards the end of the year, especially during the summer and the holidays.
3. The price per night increases with the increase in the number of bedrooms the property has.
4. Greater the number of bedrooms, lesser the number of listings. Therefore, reduced competition.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals key insights into optimal strategies for maximizing profitability in the Seattle Airbnb market. The most profitable locations are in Seattle's zip codes 98119, 98121, and 98136, indicating that demand and nightly rates in these areas are strong. Seasonal trends show that business is slower at the start of the year, with a significant rise in occupancy and nightly rates toward the end of the year, particularly during summer and holiday seasons. Additionally, the data highlights a positive relationship between the number of bedrooms and nightly rates: properties with more bedrooms command higher prices. However, listings with multiple bedrooms are less common, suggesting reduced competition for larger properties.

## Recommendations
- **Focus Listings in Profitable Zip Codes:** Target property acquisitions or optimize listings in Seattle zip codes 98119, 98121, and 98136, where the demand and profitability are highest. This strategy could help capture premium rates and steady occupancy in these high-demand areas.
- **Seasonal Pricing Strategy:** Emphasize seasonal pricing by listing properties or increasing rates during peak times, such as summer and the holiday season. Adjust rates downward at the beginning of the year to encourage occupancy during traditionally slower periods.
- **Invest in Larger Properties:** Since properties with more bedrooms attract higher nightly rates and face less competition, consider investing in larger properties. This approach can capitalize on both the high demand for spacious accommodations and the lower number of similar listings, providing a competitive advantage.
- **Optimize Occupancy for Low-Competition Listings:** For properties with multiple bedrooms, develop marketing strategies that highlight these unique accommodations. Targeting families or groups, who are likely to seek multi-bedroom options, can help sustain high occupancy and justify premium pricing.
These recommendations aim to leverage high-demand locations, seasonal trends, and strategic property configurations to maximize revenue and maintain a competitive edge in the Seattle Airbnb market.

## Future Work
Derive more valuable insights by analysing the reviews for the properties as well as by conducting analyses based on other attributes like city, property type, etc.

## Acknowlegments
This project was made possible through the support and resources provided by various data sources and community tools. Special thanks to Inside Airbnb for making valuable data on Airbnb listings publicly accessible, which formed the foundation of this analysis as well as Kaggle and Tableau Public.
